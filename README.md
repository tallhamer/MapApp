    An example project to illustrate some of the <a href="https://visionrt.com/our-solutions/maprt-api/">MapRT API</a> integration possibilities. The application is a standalone 
    python application that connects to the MapRT API and provides DICOM plan validation and clearance map visualization.
    <br /> 
    <br />
    While the application seeks to simply show integration strategies with MapRT's API it also provides some clinical 
    features that users may find useful in clinical practice. The application is provided under the MIT license and 
    can be used in clinical practice at the user's own risk.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



### Built With

[![Python 3.12.9](https://img.shields.io/badge/Python-3.12.9-blue?logo=python&logoColor=white)](https://www.python.org)
[![PySide6](https://img.shields.io/badge/PySide6-Qt%20for%20Python-41cd52?logo=qt&logoColor=white)](https://doc.qt.io/qtforpython/)

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>



<!-- GETTING STARTED -->
## Getting Started
1. If you don't already have it installed, install [Python](https://www.python.org/downloads/). I recommend version 3.12 but any version 3.10 or above should work 
    

2. Navigate to a root folder where you would like to store the virtual environment. Create a virtual python environment
   by executing the following command. (Replace *myenv* with the name of your virtual environment)
    ```sh
      python -m venv myenv
    ```
3. Navigate the the new *Scripts* folder and activate the new virtual environment using the proper active script.
   ### Windows (Command prompt):
    ```sh
      myenv\Scripts\activate.bat
    ```
   ### On Windows (PowerShell):
    ```sh
      myenv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
    ```
   ### On macOS/Linux:
    ```sh
      source myenv/bin/activate
    ```
   
4. Clone the github repo for this project using the command below or simply download the code and unzip the resulting archive to a location on 
your hard drive.
    ```sh
      git clone https://github.com/tallhamer/MapApp.git
    ```
5. With the virtual python environment activated, navigate to the location of the cloned git repo and install the project 
   dependencies using the requirement.txt file.
    ```sh
      pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```
After all of the python libraries have been successfully installed, you should be able to simply type the following from 
the activated virtual python environment to launch the application.
```sh
   python map_app.py
```

### Creating a Binary Application
If you don't want to have to activate the virtual python environment each time you want to run the application you can 
generate a standalone executable (.exe) file on windows.

1. Activating the virtual python environment using the steps above.

2. Navigate to the location where you cloned the MapApp repo

3. Verify that the *map_app.spec* file is located in the root directory

4. Run the following command
    ```sh
      pyinstaller map_app.spec
    ```
5. If you are missing the *map_app.spec* file you can run the following command replacing *FullPathToRepoFolder* with the 
   path to the cloned repository on your machine.
    ```sh
      pyinstaller map_app.py --paths=FullPathToRepoFolder -D --hidden-import=vtkmodules.util.data_model --hidden-import=vtkmodules.util.execution_model --hidden-import=skimage._shared.geometry 
    ```
The result should be a *dist* folder with a subfolder named *map_app*. You can move the *map_app* folder to any location 
and run the map_app.exe from that folder to use the application without needing to activate a virtual python environment 
in the future

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


<!-- USAGE EXAMPLES -->
## Usage

### Initial Setup
When you first run the application it will setup to locations in the root of the application folder. The first, if not 
already present, will be a *.\logs* folder. The application is very *"chatty"* logging calls to, if not all, almost all 
functions to help with the inevitable troubleshooting as the API matures. I'm also not a professional programmer, so I'm 
sure I have done things that would make a normal programmer want to kill themselves. The excessive logging helps those 
folks track down what crazy thing I did and fix their setup from my poor design decisions.

The second item that the application will create upon first run is an initial *settings.json* file that will store all 
the connection information and global settings for the application. The settings can be accessed from the **Options** menu 
within the application, so there should be no need to access or change this file from outside of the application. 

<p align="center">
<img src="images\app_settings_1.png" width="300"/> 
<img src="images\app_settings_2.png" width="300"/>
</p>

<span style="font-size:10px;">
<p align="center">

reconstruction method selected. (Right) View of the application setting dialog with the Marching Cubes surface 
reconstruction selected showing the options to set the x and y pixel size (set to 1x1 pixel resolution)
</p>
</span>

The application level settings are organized in two sets.
1. DICOM Settings
2. MapRT Settings

#### DICOM Settings

<span style="color:#0055ff"><b>Data Directory</b></span>

The DICOM data directory is where you can have your favorite DICOM SCP drop DICOM RT plan and structure set files 
so that the application can validate them using the MapRT API.

<span style="color:#0055ff"><b>Arc Check Resolution</b></span>

The angular resolution at which to validate an arc treatment field from the DICOM RT plan file.

<span style="color:#0055ff"><b>Surface Reconstruction Method</b></span>

The reconstruction method that will be used to generate the DICOM surface mesh from the DICOM RT structure contours.

- *Zero Crossing* (Default) - Uses a signed distance image to determine the zero-crossing isosurface (fastest)
- *Marchine Cubes* - Using a binary volume image generated from the structure contours (slower recon)
- *Contour Isosurface* - Using a binary volume image generated from the structure contours (slower recon)


The Marching Cubes and Contour Isosurface reconstruction methods alow the user to determine the pixel resolution in the 
**x** and **y** dimensions (z dimention is determines form the DICOM RT structure contours). The finer the resolution 
the slower the reconstruction but the closer to the TPS structure volume it will be when generating the 3D binary image 
from which the surface is generated.

<span style="color:#0055ff"><b>Contours to keep</b></span>

The contours to include in the surface generation. In DICOM RT (Radiotherapy) Structure Set files, contour 
orientationâspecifically whether the points are ordered clockwise (CW) or counter-clockwise (CCW)âis significant because 
it indicates the interior (filled area) versus the exterior (excluded area) of the contour.

- *CCW* (Default) - Keeps only the contours with counter-clockwise orientations (i.e. outer boundaries)
- *CW* - Keeps only the contours with clockwise orientation (i.e. holes)
- *ALL* - Keeps all contours with no regard for orientation

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### MapRT Settings

<span style="color:#0055ff"><b>URL</b></span>

The institution specific URL for your MapRT API install including the port the API runs on.

<span style="color:#0055ff"><b>Token</b></span>

The institution specific Bearer Token used in authentication of API calls. This will be provided by Vision RT and is 
specific to you instance of MapRT.

<span style="color:#0055ff"><b>User Agent</b></span>

The institution and version specific user agent for the MapRT API. At the time of this documentation the version should 
be *VisionRT.Integration.Saturn/2.0.0*

<p align="center">

</p>

<span style="font-size:10px;">
<p align="center">

</p>
</span>

After all of the MapRT settings are entered into the application settings the user can test the MapRT API connection to 
see if all the settings are properly configured for the MapRT API endpoint. Click the **OK** button will save all the 
changes made to the application settings. Clicking Cancel will revert all settings back to the defaults or the original 
settings resulting in all of your changes being lost.

</p>
</span>

Opening DICOM RT files from the **File->Open->DICOM RT Files** menu will populate the *Patient Context* section of the 
interface with the information from the DICOM RT Plan and DICOM RT Structure Set.
You will be presented with
- The Patient MRN
- Patient Frist Name
- Patient Last Name
- Course ID (*F1* if loaded from DICOM RT file - ESAPI integration will populate when implemented)
- Plan ID (Single unselectable option for DICOM RT file loading - multiple plans available through ESAPI)
- Isocenter coordinate (for selected plan)
- Body Structure (tries to select the body but you may need to select from the drop down for BH Body or FB Body)
- Beam (all fields from the DICOM Plan being validated)

The selected body structure is processed and the surface mesh is generated with the reconstruction method selected in 
the application settings. The resulting surface mesh can be explored in the 3D viewer to the right. 

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>

#### 3D View Manipulation and Mouse Controls
The camera orientation can be manipulated using the camera orientation widget in the upper right corner of the 3D view 
by clicking on the axis from which you would like to view the 3D model. The left mouse button will allow you to rotate 
the view around the camera focus point. Middle mouse press and hold will allow you to pan the model around the view 
port. Pressing and holding the right mouse button and dragging will allow you to zoom in and out on the model.

<p align="right">(<a href="#readme-top">back to top</a>)</p>


#### Visual Settings

</p>

<span style="font-size:10px;">
<p align="center">

</p>
</span>

All of the visual settings for the 3D view can be customized from the **3D View Settings** tab. Surface colors, laser 
colors and the view port background color can all be set for the session (unfortunately they are not *"sticky"* right 
now). The laser projections colors linked across surfaces. The laser opacity is also customizable, however the laser 
opacity is tied to the surface opacity on which it is projected to avoid lasers projections from one surface that may 
be completely transparent from being seen on the opposite surface and being mistaken for the projections on that 
surface.

<p align="center">
Examples of bitmap image save with axis orientation widget and view orientation widgets visible (Left) and a .png image 
save of the 3D model alone (Right) 
</p>
</span>

The 3D scene can be manipulated and viewed from any preferred angle or axis direction. The axis orientation widget and 
the view orientation widget can be hidden from the 3D view settings page. It is possible to save the 3D view for use in 
presentations or other outside documentation. The user can save the 3D view as a *.png* image which will set the  
viewport background to transparent or as a .bmp image which will preserve the view as seen on the screen. The axis and 
view orientation widgets will be saved in the image if visible within the view port. If the user does not desired to see
them in the output image they should be turned off the widgets prior to saving the image.

### Connection to the MapRT API

#### Surface Alignment Checks
<p align="center">
<img src="images\maprt_connect_0.png" width="800"/>
</p>

<span style="font-size:10px;">
<p align="center">
Image showing a populated MapRT Context section. Information is populated for the currently active <b>Patient Context</b>
or for the MRN provided after the <b>Fetch Data</b> button is pressed.
</p>
</span>

MapRT data for the currently active Patient Context can be retrieved from the MapRT API by clicking the *Fetch Data* 
button. The Medical Record Number from the active Patient Context will be used to query the MapRT API and retrieve not 
only the patient-specific surfaces but also the room / machine geometries available for clearance map generation. When 
the surface calls are completed the MapRT surface meshes that are returned are cached for visual display within the 
DICOM reference coordinate system.

>**Note:** The MapApp converts all coordinates to the native DICOM coordinate system of IEC-61217. All corrections to 
>MapRT surfaces and visual verification of the registration between MapRT and your DICOM structures take place in this 
> coordinate system. The consistency of coordinate frames become important when comparing DICOM structures to MapRT 
> surfaces or exporting MapRT surfaces to DICOM which will be discussed later in the documentation

Visual verification of the registration between the DICOM body structure and the MapRT surface is crutial to the proper 
use of the clearance map generated from the MapRT surface. If, as in the case represented by the image above, the DICOM 
body structure and the MapRT surface are properly aligned the clearance map can be trusted to give you the proper 
understanding of the available beam arrangements during planning. However, if the the DICOM body structure and the MapRT
surface are not properly aligned (similar to the image below) the clearance map cannot be trusted to properly reflect 
the conditions during delivery and can actually produce rather than help avoid collisions by improperly identifying safe 
beam locations during the planning process.

<p align="center">
<img src="images\misalignment_0.png" width="400"/>

<p align="center">
Identification of a misaligned DICOM surface witht he MapRT surface (Left). Corrected MapRT surface now aligned to the 
DICOM planning surface (Right)
</p>
</span>

If a DICOM to MapRT surface misalignment is identified the MapApp will allow the user to correctly align the MapRT 
surface to the DICOM RT planning surface using the *Correction* section of the MapRT Context and then resubmit the 
corrected isocenter to the MapRT API for generation of a accurate clearance map.

> Correct alignment of the MapRT surface to the DICOM body structure is a manual process and it is the responsibility of 
> the user to ensure it is done to a proper level of accuracy to allow for confidence in using the resulting clearance 
> map for planning.

#### Virtual Simulations

<p align="center">
<img src="images\maprt_connect_1.png" width="400"/>
<img src="images\maprt_connect_2.png" width="400"/>
</p>

<span style="font-size:10px;">
<p align="center">
Image showing patient look-up dialog with associated patient orientation selection dropdown (Left). Image showing result 
of loading a patient directly from MapRT API without an active Patient Context.
</p>
</span>

If there is no active Patient Context to work from (i.e. at simulation prior to planning) the MapApp will prompt the 
user for the patient Medical Record Number (MRN) and the orientation of the patient via a small dialog. The orientation 
is used to convert the MapRT surface coordinates into the standard DICOM coordinate system (IEC-61217).

Patient loaded directly from MapRT without reference to a Patient Context loaded from DICOM RT files will have a few 
distinguishing features. You will note from the right hand image above that a MapRT Preview Patient Context is generated 
and populated in the Patient Context area. Isocenter is place at <0, 0, 0> which mimics the preview plan in the native 
MapRT software. The isocenter is easily identified using the laser projections on the MapRT surface. The isocenter can
adjusted to any location using the **Correction** section of the MapRT Context section of the UI. Locating the isocenter 
within the patient surface will allow you to check the clearance map at that isocenter location. 

**To check the clearance map for the current Isocenter location** 
1. Click the **Get Map** button when you are satisfied with the visual location of isocenter as indicated by the virtual 
laser system. 
2. This will populate the clearance map in the Map View tab. 
>Clearance maps are cached in the MapApp unlike in the native MapRT application so you are free to check multiple 
> isocenter locations very rapidly due to the threaded nature of the API calls. As the clearance maps are calculated and 
> returned over the API (first as low resolution maps then as high resolution maps) the clearance map graph is updated 
> with the latest information. 
3. Each clearance map, with the settings used to generate it, are stored in the clearance map dropdown just below the 
clearance map graph for easy review. The label in the dropdown is configured as follows **[Machine] -- [Surface] -- 
[Isocenter coordinate] -- [Couch Buffer] -- [Patient Buffer]** to help you locate the proper clearance map.
>Note: The 3D visual of the isocenter is currently not linked to the dropdown selection.

This can be a useful pre-CT workflow for testing isocenter / patient positioning combinations prior to completing a 
CT simulation of the patient. Simply capture a surface of the patient and immediately pull the surface into the MapApp over the  MapRT API for virtual simulation.
